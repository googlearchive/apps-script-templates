Template: Custom Functions for Sheets
=====================================

This template provides a framework for creating custom functions
in Google Sheets. It shows the structure needed to define a
custom function and its autocomplete documentation, and provides
a few examples.

The examples provided here demonstrate:

* How to create custom functions that accept arguments of different types
* How to document a custom function to generate correct autocomplete
  information in Sheets

Note that this template must be added to a container-bound script
attached to a Google Sheet in order to function.


For more information, see [Custom Functions in Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/functions).

In addition, developers of Sheets custom functions should be aware of
the [known issues specific to Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/migration/sheets).
