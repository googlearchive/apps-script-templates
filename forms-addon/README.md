Template: Google Forms Add-on
=============================

This template provides a framework for creating a
[Google Forms add-on](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/).
It shows the structure needed to define a UI (including
menus, a sidebar and dialog) and how to coordinate communication
between the UI client and the server where the Form resides. This
template also covers some basic uses of Apps Script with Google
Forms, including:

* Creating new form items programmatically
* Setting, removing and responding to form submit triggers

Note that this template must be added to a container-bound script
attached to a Google Form in order to function. Also note that
developed add-ons must go through a
[publishing process](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/publish)
before they can be made available publicly.
