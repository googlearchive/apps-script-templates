<p>The Google Sheets add-on <i><?= addonName ?></i> was recently updated
and it needs you to re-authorize.</p>

<p>The add-on's automatic report updates are temporarily disabled until you
re-authorize. You can accomplish this by opening one of the sheets
using the add-on and running the add-on through the menu. Alternatively, you can
click this link to approve authorization directly:</p>

<p><a href="<?= url ?>">Click here</a> to re-authorize the add-on.</p>

<p>This notification email will be sent to you at most once per day until the
add-on is re-authorized.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%">This automatic message was sent to you via
the <i><?= addonName ?></i> add-on for Google Sheets.
