Template: Google Sheets Add-on
==============================

This template provides a framework for creating a
[Google Sheets add-on](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/).
It shows the structure needed to define a UI (including menus, a sidebar and
dialog) and how to coordinate communication between the UI client and the server
where the Sheet resides. This template also covers some basic uses of Apps
Script with Google Sheets, including:

* Reading and writing data to a Sheet
* Creating, copying and clearing a sheet

Note that add-ons that work with Google Sheets will usually need to
read and manipulate the Sheet data, formatting, validation, etc. For
more information, see
[Extending Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets).

In addition, developers of Sheets add-ons should be aware of the
[Known Issues specific to Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/migration/sheets).

Finally, note that this template must be added to a container-bound
script attached to a Google Sheet in order to function. Developed
add-ons must go through a
[publishing process](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/publish)
before they can be made available publicly.
