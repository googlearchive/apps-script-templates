Template: Google Docs Add-on
============================

This template provides a framework for creating a
[Google Docs add-on](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/).
It shows the structure needed to define a UI (including
menus, a sidebar and dialog) and how to coordinate communication
between the UI client and the server where the Doc resides. This
template also covers some basic uses of Apps Script with Google
Docs, including:

* Reading and writing text to and from a Google Doc
* Getting and modifying basic file information, such as the file title

Note that add-ons that work with Google Docs will usually need to read
and manipulate the (sometimes complex)
[Doc structure](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/docs#structure_of_a_document).

Finally, note that this template must be added to a container-bound
script attached to a Google Doc in order to function. Developed
add-ons must go through a
[publishing process](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/publish) 
before they can be made available publicly.
